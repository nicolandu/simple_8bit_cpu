Travel cells left-to-right.

(Rule 86 is mirror of Rule 30)

The last cell starts at 1, the rest, at 0.

For each OLD cell, leave its value alone; and if its value is
one, set the cell 1 to the left to 1, and invert the cell 2 to the left.

=> equivalent to (previous value of that cell OR previous value of cell 1 to right)
    XOR previous value of cell 2 to right
